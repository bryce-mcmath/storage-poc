# Storage Options for React Native

This document compares different storage options available for React Native applications, focusing on their performance characteristics, use cases, and security considerations.

## AsyncStorage

**Description**: AsyncStorage is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app.

**Performance**:
- **Read/Write Speed**: Moderate
- **Startup Impact**: High (especially with large datasets)
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate

**Best For**:
- Simple app preferences
- Non-sensitive user settings
- Caching non-critical data
- Apps with small to moderate storage needs

**Limitations**:
- Asynchronous API only (requires async/await)
- Limited to string storage (requires serialization)
- Performance degrades with large datasets
- Not secure for sensitive information
- Limited to 6MB on older Android devices

## MMKV (React Native MMKV)

**Description**: MMKV is a key-value storage framework developed by WeChat. It's an efficient, small, complete, cross-platform storage solution using memory mapping.

**Performance**:
- **Read/Write Speed**: Very Fast (5-10x faster than AsyncStorage)
- **Startup Impact**: Low
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized (uses memory mapping)

**Best For**:
- Performance-critical applications
- Apps with frequent storage operations
- Large datasets
- Complex data structures
- Apps that need both synchronous and asynchronous APIs

**Limitations**:
- Requires native module installation
- Storage size limitation (~100MB recommended max)

## Secure Storage Options

### react-native-keychain

**Description**: Uses the Keychain Services API on iOS and the Keystore API on Android for secure credential storage.

**Performance**:
- **Read/Write Speed**: Moderate
- **Security Level**: High

**Best For**:
- Storing credentials (username/password)
- API tokens and OAuth tokens
- Private keys
- Any sensitive information

**Limitations**:
- Limited to specific credential types
- More complex API
- Not suitable for large amounts of data

### expo-secure-store

**Description**: Expo's secure storage solution that provides a way to encrypt and securely store key-value pairs locally.

**Performance**:
- **Read/Write Speed**: Moderate
- **Security Level**: High

**Best For**:
- Storing API keys
- Auth tokens
- Any sensitive information that needs encryption
- Expo-based applications

**Limitations**:
- 2KB size limit per value on iOS
- Limited to string values
- Only for Expo projects or projects with Expo modules

## Storage Comparison Matrix

| Feature | AsyncStorage | MMKV | react-native-keychain | expo-secure-store |
|---------|-------------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Performance** | Moderate | Very Fast | Moderate | Moderate |
| **API** | Async only | Sync & Async | Async only | Async only |
| **Data Types** | Strings only | Multiple | Specific credential types | Strings only |
| **Security** | None (unencrypted) | Optional encryption | High (system-level) | High (system-level) |
| **Size Limit** | ~6MB (some Android) | ~100MB recommended | Small values only | 2KB per value (iOS) |
| **Ease of Use** | Simple | Simple | Moderate | Simple |
| **Installation** | Built-in or npm | npm + linking | npm + linking | Expo or npm + config |

## Choosing the Right Storage Option

1. **For general app data and settings**:
   - MMKV is the best all-around choice for performance
   - AsyncStorage is simpler if performance isn't critical

2. **For sensitive information**:
   - react-native-keychain for non-Expo projects
   - expo-secure-store for Expo projects

3. **For large datasets**:
   - MMKV for in-memory performance
   - SQLite (via react-native-sqlite-storage or expo-sqlite) for relational data
   - Realm for complex object data

4. **For offline-first apps**:
   - WatermelonDB for high-performance offline-capable apps
   - Realm for complex offline synchronization needs

## Migration Strategy

When migrating from AsyncStorage to MMKV:

1. Create a compatibility layer to maintain the same API
2. Migrate data stores one by one
3. Measure performance before and after
4. Consider running both in parallel during transition

## Best Practices

1. **Data Organization**:
   - Group related data with prefixed keys
   - Consider separating concerns into different storage instances

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Always wrap storage operations in try/catch
   - Implement fallback mechanisms

3. **Performance**:
   - Batch operations when possible
   - Be mindful of storing large objects
   - Use appropriate serialization methods

4. **Security**:
   - Always use secure storage for sensitive information
   - Consider encryption options for MMKV if storing semi-sensitive data
